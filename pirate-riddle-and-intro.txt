"I’m a sailor’s snack, both salty and dry,
I come in a box, not from the sky.
Parrots might squawk and call me by name,
Guess me now, or face yer shame!"

You have been captured by the ruthless crew of the dreaded pirate ship The Crimson Corsair, and been thrown into the brig. 

Tell me the magic word and I will give you the key to escape. Rumour has it, the last prisoner left a trail of clues in their attempt to escape.
