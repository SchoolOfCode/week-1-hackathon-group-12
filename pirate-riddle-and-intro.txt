"I’m a sailor’s snack, both salty and dry,
I come in a box, not from the sky.
Parrots might squawk and call me by name,
Guess me now, or face yer shame!"
What be I, matey?




Ahoy, matey! You’ve found yourself in a heap o’ trouble. Captured by the ruthless crew of the dreaded pirate ship Blackstorm’s Revenge, you’ve been thrown into the brig, a dark, creaky cell deep below deck. The air is damp, and the scent of salt and rust lingers around you. Through the iron bars, you can hear the distant sound of waves crashing and the raucous laughter of the pirates celebrating their latest plunder.
But you won’t be left to rot in this cage—not if you can help it. Rumour has it, the last prisoner left a trail of clues in their attempt to escape. With a bit of cunning, a dash of courage, and a sharp eye for detail, you might just find the tools you need to break free.
The captain returns at sunrise, and if you’re still here, you’ll be walking the plank. The clock is ticking—can you solve the riddle and escape the brig before it’s too late?
